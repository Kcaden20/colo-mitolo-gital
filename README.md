# Colo-Mitolo-Gital
This is the container website for Kevin Cadena's interactive anthology series "Colo-Mitolo-Gital". The different chapters reinterpret different family stories while layering in Colombian history and culture as a way to understand my own heritage through the lens of computation, the web, and play. Each object represents a chapter within the anthology.

Designed, Developed and Produced during the Babycastles Residency Program from the Fall '20 to the Winter '21.
